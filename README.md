# Rental-analysis
This comes from Codecademy Master Statistics Live Series (no.2)
Some information were provided about rentals in New YorK city, containing quantitive and categorical data.
1. Quantitive data such as rent, building age per years, minutes to subway, size per square feet were explored further with central tendency and spreed. Histograms were plotted using both matplotlib and seaborn. Boxplots were also used for visualization of such quantitative values.
2. Categorical data such as boroughs, submarkets and available amenities (washer/dryer, dishwasher, dorman). Frequencies and proprtions were calculated for some. Barplots from seaborn were used to visualize such categorical values.
